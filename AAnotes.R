#check "realistic" movement speed from data (mean velocity probably fine)

#play with parameters of the model to match data (make straighter lines, force occasional mistakes)

#then run some optimiser to get something reasonable

#goal is to have a model against which to compare submovement model

#if it's never going to work it will hopefully be obvious soon
